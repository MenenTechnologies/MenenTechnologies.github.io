Instructions for HTML files:
-Make sure to close every tag
-lang="en" has a special meaning for the PHP/XHTML parser
	lang="en" means translate this element all together without including it in its parent
	lang="" means this element should not be translated
-check strings in po files before doing push-ts command to avoid machine translation of wrong string (which there is a limit each month)
